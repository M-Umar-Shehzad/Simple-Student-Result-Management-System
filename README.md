# Foundational C++ Practice

A comprehensive collection of C++ implementations focusing on core syntax, memory concepts, and algorithmic building blocks. 

This repository serves as a technical playground and reference library for mastering the mechanics of the C++ language, ranging from basic control flow to advanced object-oriented design (Currently working on the basics).

## Repository Structure

The codebase is organized by concept to facilitate modular learning and easy reference.

### Planned Modules
* **Control Flow:** `if-else`, `switch`, and conditional logic.
* **Iterative Logic:** `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops (including nested variations).
* **Data Handling:** Arrays, Strings, and Pointers.
* **Modular Programming:** Functions, recursion, and header management.
* **Object-Oriented Programming:** Classes, Objects, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

> *Note: Specific modules are documented within their respective directories.*
