# Functions

## Module Overview
This directory focuses on **code reusability** and **structural logic** in C++.

## Key Concepts
* **Function Structure:** Understanding Return Type, Function Name, and Parameters.
* **Prototypes vs. Definitions:** Declaring functions before `main()` and defining them later.
* **Parameter Passing:**
    * *Pass by Value:* Copying data into the function.
    * *Pass by Reference:* Operating directly on the original variable.
* **Scope & Lifetime:** Understanding Local vs. Global variables.
