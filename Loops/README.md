# Iterative Control Structures (Loops)

## Module Overview
This directory focuses on **repetition logic** and **flow control** in C++. It contains implementations demonstrating how to execute code blocks repeatedly based on specific conditions, which is essential for algorithms requiring data traversal, series calculation, or pattern generation.

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Loop Types
* **`for` Loops:** Deterministic iteration (used when the number of iterations is known).
* **`while` Loops:** Entry-controlled iteration (used for indefinite conditions).
* **`do-while` Loops:** Exit-controlled iteration (guarantees at least one execution).
